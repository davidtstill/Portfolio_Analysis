# Portfolio_Analysis

This analysis evaluates the performance among various algorithmic, hedge, and mutual fund portfolios and compares them against the S&P 500. Afterwards, I created a second portfolio (called "My Portfolio") utilizing the historical closing prices for Qualcomm, Coke and Disney to see how this group performed against the various funds and the S&P 500. 

Key findings include:
- Algo 1, an algorithmic trading hedgefund, had the highest cumulative return and the S&P 500 had the lowest. 
- Berkshire Bathaway and Tiger Global Management both had higher annualized standard deviations than the S&P 500 and are considered riskier investments. 
- Algo 1 had the highest Sharpe Ratio by far at 1.36. Berkshire Hathaway and Algo 2 also had high Sharpe ratios at 0.52 and 0.51 respectively.
- My Portfolio had the 3rd highest standard deviation and the 4th highest Sharpe ratio, indicating that strong returns helped to offset the higher volaility.
